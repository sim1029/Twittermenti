#  Twittermenti

## Goal

Learn how to use twitter API and CoreML to analize public sentiments regarding products, people, events...

## What I created

Go ahead, ask Twittermenti anything, anything at all, as long as someone somewhere has tweeted about it, Twittermenti can harness the power of machine learning to tell you what people feel about your topic question based soley on their tweets. I'm not here to tell you how to use the information Twittermenti produces (Stock market predictions...) but darn if it isn't spot on accurate. I know magicians are never to reveal their tricks but I just did, it's machine learning. Real magic.

# What I learned

* Using twitter api through swifter
* Querying twitter API to return specific tweets
